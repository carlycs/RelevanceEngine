#Currently, small online businesses with little user activity on their search engines have no good way of evaluating the performance
#of their search algorithms,making it difficult for them to provide an exceptional customer experience.

#The goal of this engine is to create a model for airgas that can be used to measure the relevance of search results.
#In doing so, we'll be helping enable naive customers to better sort out their seearch results for small business owners
#to match the experience provided by more resource rich competitors like Amazon.
#This engine will also provide airgas a model to test against. Given the queries and resulting product descriptions
#from their Google Ad campaign. This product will help airgas to evaluate the accuracy of their search algorithms.
